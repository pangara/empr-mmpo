The pre-application stage is an important stage of the process, and requires a collaborative effort by the MMPO Project Team, advisory committee and the proponent to support an efficient and timely process. There are no statutory timelines in the pre-application stage, and time spent ensuring that the review process is understood by all, that all required authorizations have been identified, and that identification and scoping of issues and information requirements have been thoroughly discussed and agreed to by the advisory committee will greatly increase the certainty of a timely review.

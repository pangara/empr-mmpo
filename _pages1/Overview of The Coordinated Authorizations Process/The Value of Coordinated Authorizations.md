## The Value of Coordinated Authorizations

The coordinated authorizations process strives to reduce time, expense and risk while improving decisions. Streamlining and coordinating the permit application process provides benefits for proponents, First Nations, the public and the government.

**The Proponent** of a major mine will have a government project lead assigned to coordinate the review process. The project lead, with the assistance of the advisory committee, provides proponents with a more clear and concise understanding about application requirements. Proponents have the opportunity to bundle their applications into a single submission to gain efficiencies; these options are described below in detail.

**First Nations** are able to assess the project as a whole within a harmonized consultation process instead of having to respond to a series of piecemeal consultations.

**The Public**'s safety, environmental and economic interests are served by informed and durable decisions supported by a comprehensive review, including public review and comment period(s) during both the EA and permit review processes.

**Government** staff and resources are used more effectively and efficiently. Facilitated coordination of natural resource agencies can improve consistency of approach, reduce overlap and share expertise.

### Concurrent Approval Regulation
---

The _Environmental Assessment Act_ Concurrent Approval Regulation allows proponents to apply for the concurrent review of provincial authorizations for a proposed project that is undergoing the EA process.

The Concurrent Approval Regulation stipulates that Provincial ministries must proceed expeditiously with their review and consideration of the proponent's application(s) for eligible approval, and within 75 days of the date on which the proponent's application for an environmental assessment certificate was accepted, notify the proponent and the Environmental Assessment Office of any additional information required from the proponent in order to complete the application review.

Should an environmental assessment certificate be issued to a proponent, the ministry must, within 60 days after the issuance:

(a) issue the eligible approval,

(b) refuse to issue the eligible approval and provide reasons for the refusal, or

(c) specify a later date on which the proponent will be given a decision on the application for the eligible approval and provide reasons for the delay.

Although the Concurrent Approval Regulation stipulates sector ministries must proceed expeditiously with their permit review and recommendations to statutory decision makers, there is a potential risk for proponents following the issuance of an environmental assessment certificate, should a ministry proceed to recommendations while there may be outstanding information requirements and/or issues related to the permit review process.

With this in mind, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, in coordination with Provincial natural resource sector agencies, applies the synchronous permitting model (described below) in an effort to address the risks associated with the concurrent approval regulation.

For more information about the environmental assessment process, refer to the [EAO User Guide](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/pdf/EAO_User_Guide%20Final-Mar2011.pdf) and other information on the EAO website: [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/).

### Synchronous Permitting
---

Synchronous permitting provides the same flexibility as the concurrent approval regulation for a coordinated EA and permit review process. Parties involved in the coordinated review process, however, are not bound by legislated timelines in order to make permitting decisions, post EA. Therefore, this option provides the time required to resolve potentially outstanding issues or substantial project changes that may arise during the coordinated review process. In addition, this option:

- Allows technical reviewers, who are typically the same members of the EA working group and the permitting advisory committee, the capacity to focus on the environmental assessment prior to the detailed permit review process;

- Provides proponents the time to address any significant issues that may require resolution during the EA, prior to finalizing their permit applications; and,
- Allows provincial statutory decision makers the time to identify where issues brought forward during the EA process may be appropriately addressed in permitting.

### Sequential Permitting
---

Proponents may also choose to apply for sequential permitting. This process involves undergoing the EA process first; should an environmental assessment certificate be issued, permits for construction and operations are then subsequently applied for. The added benefit of sequential permitting is the ability for all parties involved in the review of a project to focus on the EA process prior to permitting.

### Phases of the Coordinated authorizations Process

This section of the guide presents a detailed summary of the coordinated authorizations process. Figure 5 summarizes the four stages of the coordinated authorizations process.

### Guidance
---

MMPO has developed the following tools to help Project Leads guide Proponents through the Coordinated Authorizations Process:

#### Coordinated Authorizations Guide

This guide is intended to outline the coordinated authorizations review process for major mine projects that require multiple permits, licences or other authorizations (regulatory requirements) for construction and operation in the province of British Columbia. For the purposes of this guide, a major mine is a proposed or operating mine as defined in the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia (Code).

#### Information Requirements Table

The Information Requirements Table (IRT) serves as the single list of information requirements for a Mines Act permit application, issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and an effluent discharge permit application under the Environmental Management Act (EMA), by the Ministry of Environment (MOE). The IRT is intended to:

Be used in conjunction with the document entitled, "Joint Application Information Requirements for Mines Act and Environmental Management Act Permits" and is intended for use in the development of both new and/or permit amendment applications. The information contained within the IRT will be developed to meet the unique nature of each project.

Aid MOE and MEM during the screening phase; inform clients of the detailed information required to support MA and EMA permit applications and ensure all the information necessary to support the MA and EMA applications is provided.

#### Joint Application Information Requirements for Mines Act and Environmental Management Act Permits

The Application Information Requirements document sets out the information that is required to support a joint application for a Mines Act (MA) permit issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and (if required) an effluent discharge permit issued under the Environmental Management Act (EMA) by the Ministry of Environment (MOE). This document is intended for both new and existing major mines, including proposed major expansions/extensions of mining projects. The combined technical information requirements are intended to reduce overlap in technical information required by both ministries and enable one application, or bundled applications, to be submitted for review.

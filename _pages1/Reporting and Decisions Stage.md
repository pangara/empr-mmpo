The advisory committee provides recommendations to statutory decision makers (SDMs) and does not have any decision-making authority. At the end of the committee's review of the applications, the project lead will prepare a summary report on behalf of the committee and submit it to the appropriate SDMs for permit decisions. The summary report contains information on the proposed project, the review process and timelines, the issues raised during review and how they were resolved, and a summary of First Nations and public consultation.

As well, the First Nations consultation advisor for the advisory committee will prepare a detailed First Nations consultation report for SDMs, which identifies First Nations interests and suggested mitigations, provides details of the consultation process, and assesses how the process satisfied the Province's legal obligations to consult and accommodate.

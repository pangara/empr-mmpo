### Change Tracking
---

When a change to the scope or schedule of a project has been identified the Project Lead will gather details regarding the proposed requirement for change. With the assistance of the person requesting the change, the Project Lead will complete a Change Request Form. The Change Request Form summarizes the changes including background, proposed change, benefits, consequences, change analysis impact and approvals. As well, the Project Lead will track all project changes in a Change Log.

### Issue Tracking
---

The Project Lead (MRC Chair) will track technical issues raised by MRC members throughout the coordinated authorizations process in an Issues Tracking Table. The management and responsibility for the issue tracking should be worked out among all review participants including the Proponent to ensure efficiencies, accuracy, objectivity and it is useful to SDMs.

### Risk Tracking
---

The Project lead can track risks with a risk register. All project risks are documented and prioritized in the risk register. Best practice for risk management is to review the risk register regularly and address them during project status meetings.

### Lessons Learned Log
---

Throughout each project life cycle, lessons are learned and opportunities for improvement are discovered. Documenting lessons learned helps the team discover the root causes of problems that occurred and avoid those problems in later project stages or future projects. It also allows for better planning of later project stages and future projects, improving implementation of new projects, and preventing or minimizing risks for future projects.

### Action Tracker

Actions coming out of project meeting and discussions with stakeholders or First Nations can be easily tracked and logged using an action tracker. Actions should be reviewed regularly and closed out when complete.

## Project Planning

### Project Charter
---

The purpose of this Project Charter is to provide a shared understanding of the coordinated authorization process for Major Mine Projects as it applies to each Project. The Project Charter also outlines the scope and objectives of the process, major risks and the roles and responsibilities of all Project Stakeholders and First Nations.

A Project Charter is developed at the outset of the coordinated authorizations process by a designated Project Lead with input from the Proponent and Project participants. Once complete the Project Charter will approved by the Project Director before going to the Major Mine Project Board for approval. The Project Charter is updated as necessary when elements within the Charter change.

The MMPO Project Charter has the following goals:

- To provide a shared understanding of how permit applications for a project are managed through the coordinated authorization process.
- To set the scope and objectives for the coordinated authorizations process for a project.
- To provide the proponent and the province with background on the project and First Nations engagement.
- To provide roles and responsibilities and an organizational chart for participants managing permit applications through the coordinated authorization process.
- To outline major deliverables and milestones of the coordinated authorizations process.
- To provide a communication plan outlining the reports and meetings included as part of the coordinated authorizations process.
- To outline the major risks to the schedule or scope of the coordinated authorizations process.

### Baseline Schedule
---

The purpose of the baseline Schedule is to identify initial timelines for project milestones, activities and deliverables. Project schedules are developed, revised and maintained by MMPO Project Leads.

Steps to New Schedule Development:

1. New schedules are drafted by Project Leads using input from the proponent and members of the MRC.
2. The Project Management Centre (PMC) offers advice on the workloads of project resources over the timeline of the draft permit schedule.
3. The Project Lead revises the draft permit based on the advice of the PMC
4. The revised draft of the schedule then is shared with members of the MRC for feedback.
5. The Project lead develops the final draft of the permit schedule using the feedback of the members of the MRC.
6. The Project Director then takes the final draft permit schedule to the Chief Inspectors Office (CIO) for approval.
7. Final draft permit schedules approved by the CIO are then sent to the Major Mine Permitting Board for final approval.
8. Once new permit schedules are approved by the Board they are considered the baseline schedule for the project.

### Resource Management
---

The availability of resources is an important part of developing meaningful schedules. The MMPO Project Management Centre maintains a workload forecast tool that estimates the availability of technical resources to review applications. The tool is used in planning and the development of new schedules.

### Risk Management
---

Risks play a significant part in any project. The purpose of the risk management plan is to establish the framework in which the project team will identify risks and develop strategies to mitigate or avoid those risks.

### Change Management
---

Project Leads are responsible for identifying change within the project. When a valid change is identified the Project Lead will work with the Proponent, the PMC and members of the MRC to initiate the change management process with the completion of a change request form. The change request form details the impact on the schedule, change level, and benefits/costs of the proposed change. The Project Lead will review level 1 changes for approval and forward level 2 and 3 changes to the appropriate approval level. Once a change is reviewed and approved, the Project Lead will record the change into the Change Management Log and revise the permit schedule. If the change is rejected, the change request will be recorded in the change log as rejected.

### Issue Management
---

Project Leads manage two types of issues throughout each stage of the project, technical issues and project issues. Technical Issues are generated by the MRC and are the responsibility of the proponent to resolve while project issues can be generated by anyone and impact the deliverables or milestones of the project.

Issue Management involves the implementation of five key processes:

- The identification of project issues
- The evaluation and documentation of project issues
- The determination of issue resolution actions
- The monitoring and control of assigned issue resolution actions
- The closure of project issues.

### Information Management
---

Project Leads are responsible for organizing and storing project related information on the MMPO LAN. As well, as the chair of the MRC Project Leads are responsible for setting up and managing a SharePoint site for MRC related information.

### Draft Authorizations
---

Based on a review of a project description, the advisory committee works with the proponent to identify issues and information requirements, including any conditions or proponent commitments from the environmental assessment process that are within the scope of the committees review. For those issues that are outside the scope of review, it is important to provide an explanation of why they are not to be considered and where in other processes they may be addressed.

Regulatory authorizations that may be required for a major mine will vary depending on the project, and may include but not be limited to:

- _Environmental Assessment Act_ requirements, including a potential amendment to an existing Environmental Assessment Certificate;
- _Heritage Conservation Act_ requirements;
- _Forest Act_ occupant license-to-cut for removal of timber;
- Special Use permit under the Provincial Forest Use Regulation of the _Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act_ for access road construction off a mineral claim and within a Provincial Forest
- _Health Act_ Industrial Camp Regulation permits for construction and operation of camp facilities and potable water;
- _Water Sustainability Act_ approvals and licenses for changes in or about a stream or to store, use or divert water; _Land Act_ licenses and leases for infrastructure such as aggregate borrow pits and power lines off mining tenures, and
- Federal authorizations related to:
  - _Fisheries Act_ Section 35 for habitat alteration, disruption or destruction
  - Schedule 2 of the Metal Mine Effluent Regulation of the _Fisheries Act_ for approval to discharge deleterious material into a fish bearing habitat
  - _Migratory Birds Convention Act_ and its regulations for impacts on habitat of migratory birds;
  - _Navigation Protection Act_ for authorization to cross a navigable stream; and
  - _Explosives Act_ for manufacture and storage of explosives.

Some legislation has requirements to be addressed although no authorizations (permits) are involved, such as:

- _Species at Risk Act_, and the Canada – British Columbia Agreement on Species at Risk (2005), and
- _Fisheries Act_ - Metal Mining Effluent Regulations.

  
#### Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Authorizations

**Mineral Tenure**

Tenure provides an exclusive or preferred right of access to explore for, develop, and remove resources. For a major mine, tenure initially comes from a mineral claim under the _Mineral Tenure Act_ or a _Coal Act_ coal licence.

The Mineral Titles Office of MEM administers the statutes and manages the recording system pertaining to the acquisition and maintenance of mineral, placer and coal rights in the Province. More information: [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/mineral-titles](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/mineral-titles).

A mineral claim or coal licence must be converted to a mining lease under the _Mineral Tenure Act_ or a coal lease under the _Coal Act_ before production can exceed the limits specified in legislation.

| Statute | Tenure | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Mineral Tenure Act_ | Mineral Claim | Subsurface rights to minerals in a defined unit, up to 10,000 tonnes per year per unit. |
|| Mining Lease | Conversion of mineral claim to a mining lease is necessary before production can exceed above limits. |
||||
| _Coal Act_ | Coal Licence | Rights to explore for and develop coal on the licence location up to a single 100,000 tonne bulk sample. |
|| Coal Lease | Conversion of coal license to a coal lease is necessary before production exceeds above limit. |

#### Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy Authorizations

**Waste Discharge Authorizations**

| Activity | Discharge from the mine site to the environment. 
- Effluent discharges (such as acid and neutral rock drainage, tailing pond supernatant, mine influenced run-off and sewage);
- Air emissions (such as refuse incinerator emissions, emissions from large power generating plants, emissions from milling process), and
- Solid wastes (such as mill tailings, water treatment plant sludge, municipal and industrial refuse).
 |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Waste Discharge Permit or Approval |
| Description | The _Environmental Management Act_ permit application can seek authorization for the site preparation and construction stage (erosion and sediment control and blasting residues) and operations stage (metal/chemical residues and contact water and tailings). Alternatively, the proponent may take a two-step approach to the _Environmental Management Act_ permit by seeking authorization for only the site preparation and construction stage and deferring authorization via a permit amendment for the operations stage until engineering is sufficiently detailed to support an application for amendment to the permit. Authorizations can take the form of a permit or, for short-term discharges up to 15 months duration, an approval. |

**Use Existing Industrial Road**

"Forest service road" is a designation under the _Forest Act_ which allows the road to be administered by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural development and requires the ministry to ensure that the road is maintained.

Industrial use of a forest service road must be authorised under a road use permit (RUP). Typically, a RUP authorizes use of one or more segments of road. Section 79 of the _Forest and Range Practices Act_'s Forest Planning and Practices Regulation allows the district manager to order the holder of an RUP to assume surface maintenance obligations for the segments covered by the RUP. The regulation also defines what the maintenance obligations entail. Subsequent users of the same road segments are not to be designated as having surface maintenance responsibilities; however, they are responsible to pay a reasonable cost to the user having the surface maintenance obligations.

The RUP application form is available at [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/resource-roads/engineering-publications-permits](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/resource-roads/engineering-publications-permits).

Holders of an agreement under the _Forest Act_ or _Range Act_ may have a road permit to construct, maintain and use an industrial road.

Road permits and special use permits are non-exclusive tenures which normally allow access to the public and other industrial users.

If an industrial road is under a road permit or a special use permit, the legislation requires other industrial users to give notice to the permit holder and to make a reasonable contribution towards road maintenance. Therefore, the parties must enter into a road maintenance agreement.

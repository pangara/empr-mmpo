Once a major mine project advances to a stage where multiple authorizations are required, the CIM may establish a project-specific advisory committee to coordinate and review the applications and provide advice to Provincial statutory decision makers (SDMs). Further, the CIM may request that MMPO chair the advisory committee. Once the advisory committee is established, MMPO assigns a project lead to manage the coordinated review process.

The goal of the coordinated authorizations process is to coordinate the review of multiple authorizations including both technical and First Nations consultation and accommodation conversations required from the various natural resource agencies for new and expanding major mines.

The coordinated authorization process is meant to improve consistency and eliminate overlap and duplication in process and information requirements by the various natural resource agencies. The advisory committee provides recommendations through their technical review; statutory decision makers within each natural resource agency maintain responsibility for their respective individual permitting decisions.

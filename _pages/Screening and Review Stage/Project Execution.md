Project meetings including MRC meetings will occur throughout the coordinated authorizations process and should be supported with agendas, action trackers and meeting notes to ensure efficiency and consistency.

### Status Reports
---

Project Leads are responsible for providing regular Project Status Reports to their Directors. Project Status Reports consist of three major components to reporting project status:

- Project health: An indication if the project is on schedule or not and if not why not.
- Milestones: An indication of accomplishments and which milestones are complete, which ones are in progress, and which ones are coming up next.
- Issues and Risks: Brief details about each issue or risk to help managers make decisions on any necessary support.

### Public Review and Comment
---

Applicants for a mining lease are also subject to a legal requirement to post a notice in the office of the chief gold commissioner stating that the recorded holder intends to apply for a mining lease. They must also publish this in one issue of the Gazette, and once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the mineral claim is situated. A person claiming a right to the minerals of any kind must commence a proceeding in the Supreme Court within 80 days after the date of posting of the notice.

Applicants for a _Mines Act_ permit are subject to a legal requirement to advertise project proposals upon submission of the application and make information available for public review, with 30 days available for public review and comment [Part 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 of the Code].

Additionally, applicants for an effluent discharge permit under the _Environmental Management Act_ are required to provide public notice of an application in accordance with the [Public Notification Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/202_94), available at [http://www.bclaws.ca/](http://www.bclaws.ca/).

Other authorizations typically required for ancillary infrastructure like transmission lines, access roads, camps and staging areas also require both public adverting and stakeholder engagement; for example, a _Land Act_ tenure application for a transmission line.

The project lead will coordinate with members of the advisory committee to provide direction to the proponent regarding the format and method of public notification, including opportunities to make a joint notification for the ancillary and primary authorizations that require public advertising including making the applications available for review and a common public comment review period.

### First Nations Consultation and Accommodation
---

Before issuing authorizations for any mining activity, the Province has a legal responsibility to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate First Nations with Aboriginal interests in the project area. The Province also has treaty-specific responsibilities where there are established treaty rights. The advisory committee's First Nations consultation advisor is responsible for leading and coordinating the First Nations consultation process.

The procedures were released in July 2010 as interim in order to review them with First Nations. To view the document, click on [Updated Procedures for Meeting Legal Obligations When Consulting First Nations: Interim](http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/reports/down/updated_procedures.pdf).

Accommodation includes activities to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts or concerns respecting Aboriginal interests brought forwards by a First Nation during engagement. Accommodation options could include:

- Changing the timing of a proposed activity;

- Altering the footprint or location of a proposed activity;
- Avoiding the Aboriginal interest;
- Environmental monitoring, and,
- Other mitigation strategies (i.e. agreements).

Proponent-driven initiatives such as modifying mine plans to minimize potential impacts, avoiding sensitive areas, developing mitigation strategies, carrying out environmental monitoring programs or developing benefit and other business agreements with First Nations can also contribute to the decision-making process.

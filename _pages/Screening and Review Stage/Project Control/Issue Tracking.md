### Issue Tracking

The Project Lead (MRC Chair) will track technical issues raised by MRC members throughout the coordinated authorizations process in an Issues Tracking Table. The management and responsibility for the issue tracking should be worked out among all review participants including the Proponent to ensure efficiencies, accuracy, objectivity and it is useful to SDMs.

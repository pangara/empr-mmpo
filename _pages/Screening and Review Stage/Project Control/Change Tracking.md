### Change Tracking

When a change to the scope or schedule of a project has been identified the Project Lead will gather details regarding the proposed requirement for change. With the assistance of the person requesting the change, the Project Lead will complete a Change Request Form. The Change Request Form summarizes the changes including background, proposed change, benefits, consequences, change analysis impact and approvals. As well, the Project Lead will track all project changes in a Change Log.

### Lessons Learned Log

Throughout each project life cycle, lessons are learned and opportunities for improvement are discovered. Documenting lessons learned helps the team discover the root causes of problems that occurred and avoid those problems in later project stages or future projects. It also allows for better planning of later project stages and future projects, improving implementation of new projects, and preventing or minimizing risks for future projects.

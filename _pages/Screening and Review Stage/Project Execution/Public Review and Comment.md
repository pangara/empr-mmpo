### Public Review and Comment

Applicants for a mining lease are also subject to a legal requirement to post a notice in the office of the chief gold commissioner stating that the recorded holder intends to apply for a mining lease. They must also publish this in one issue of the Gazette, and once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the mineral claim is situated. A person claiming a right to the minerals of any kind must commence a proceeding in the Supreme Court within 80 days after the date of posting of the notice.

Applicants for a _Mines Act_ permit are subject to a legal requirement to advertise project proposals upon submission of the application and make information available for public review, with 30 days available for public review and comment [Part 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 of the Code].

Additionally, applicants for an effluent discharge permit under the _Environmental Management Act_ are required to provide public notice of an application in accordance with the [Public Notification Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/202_94), available at [http://www.bclaws.ca/](http://www.bclaws.ca/).

Other authorizations typically required for ancillary infrastructure like transmission lines, access roads, camps and staging areas also require both public adverting and stakeholder engagement; for example, a _Land Act_ tenure application for a transmission line.

The project lead will coordinate with members of the advisory committee to provide direction to the proponent regarding the format and method of public notification, including opportunities to make a joint notification for the ancillary and primary authorizations that require public advertising including making the applications available for review and a common public comment review period.

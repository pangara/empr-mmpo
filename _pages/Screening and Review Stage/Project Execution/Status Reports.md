### Status Reports

Project Leads are responsible for providing regular Project Status Reports to their Directors. Project Status Reports consist of three major components to reporting project status:

- Project health: An indication if the project is on schedule or not and if not why not.
- Milestones: An indication of accomplishments and which milestones are complete, which ones are in progress, and which ones are coming up next.
- Issues and Risks: Brief details about each issue or risk to help managers make decisions on any necessary support.

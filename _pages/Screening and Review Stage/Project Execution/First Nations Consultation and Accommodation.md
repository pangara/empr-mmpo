### First Nations Consultation and Accommodation

Before issuing authorizations for any mining activity, the Province has a legal responsibility to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate First Nations with Aboriginal interests in the project area. The Province also has treaty-specific responsibilities where there are established treaty rights. The advisory committee's First Nations consultation advisor is responsible for leading and coordinating the First Nations consultation process.

The procedures were released in July 2010 as interim in order to review them with First Nations. To view the document, click on [Updated Procedures for Meeting Legal Obligations When Consulting First Nations: Interim](http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/reports/down/updated_procedures.pdf).

Accommodation includes activities to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts or concerns respecting Aboriginal interests brought forwards by a First Nation during engagement. Accommodation options could include:

- Changing the timing of a proposed activity;

- Altering the footprint or location of a proposed activity;
- Avoiding the Aboriginal interest;
- Environmental monitoring, and,
- Other mitigation strategies (i.e. agreements).

Proponent-driven initiatives such as modifying mine plans to minimize potential impacts, avoiding sensitive areas, developing mitigation strategies, carrying out environmental monitoring programs or developing benefit and other business agreements with First Nations can also contribute to the decision-making process.

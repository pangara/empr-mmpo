### Mine Review Committee Report

The purpose of this report is to provide SDMs with information from which to make an informed and durable decision. As such, care should be taken to ensure the report contains:

- the appropriate information on the process undertaken to meet each statutory requirement; information distribution and comment;
- identification of issues raised and how they were addressed and if not, why not; and
- matters for each decision-maker to take into consideration in making a decision.

The report is not intended to be a Reasons for Decision document and does not preclude additional information a SDM may use to make a decision or to develop permit conditions.

### Sequential Permitting

Proponents may also choose to apply for sequential permitting. This process involves undergoing the EA process first; should an environmental assessment certificate be issued, permits for construction and operations are then subsequently applied for. The added benefit of sequential permitting is the ability for all parties involved in the review of a project to focus on the EA process prior to permitting.

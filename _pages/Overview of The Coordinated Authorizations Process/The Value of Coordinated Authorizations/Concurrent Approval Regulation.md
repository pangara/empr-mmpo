### Concurrent Approval Regulation

The _Environmental Assessment Act_ Concurrent Approval Regulation allows proponents to apply for the concurrent review of provincial authorizations for a proposed project that is undergoing the EA process.

The Concurrent Approval Regulation stipulates that Provincial ministries must proceed expeditiously with their review and consideration of the proponent's application(s) for eligible approval, and within 75 days of the date on which the proponent's application for an environmental assessment certificate was accepted, notify the proponent and the Environmental Assessment Office of any additional information required from the proponent in order to complete the application review.

Should an environmental assessment certificate be issued to a proponent, the ministry must, within 60 days after the issuance:

(a) issue the eligible approval,

(b) refuse to issue the eligible approval and provide reasons for the refusal, or

(c) specify a later date on which the proponent will be given a decision on the application for the eligible approval and provide reasons for the delay.

Although the Concurrent Approval Regulation stipulates sector ministries must proceed expeditiously with their permit review and recommendations to statutory decision makers, there is a potential risk for proponents following the issuance of an environmental assessment certificate, should a ministry proceed to recommendations while there may be outstanding information requirements and/or issues related to the permit review process.

With this in mind, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, in coordination with Provincial natural resource sector agencies, applies the synchronous permitting model (described below) in an effort to address the risks associated with the concurrent approval regulation.

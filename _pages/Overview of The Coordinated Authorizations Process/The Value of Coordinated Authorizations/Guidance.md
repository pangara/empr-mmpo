### Guidance

MMPO has developed the following tools to help Project Leads guide Proponents through the Coordinated Authorizations Process:

#### Coordinated Authorizations Guide

This guide is intended to outline the coordinated authorizations review process for major mine projects that require multiple permits, licences or other authorizations (regulatory requirements) for construction and operation in the province of British Columbia. For the purposes of this guide, a major mine is a proposed or operating mine as defined in the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia (Code).

#### Information Requirements Table

The Information Requirements Table (IRT) serves as the single list of information requirements for a Mines Act permit application, issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and an effluent discharge permit application under the Environmental Management Act (EMA), by the Ministry of Environment (MOE). The IRT is intended to:

Be used in conjunction with the document entitled, "Joint Application Information Requirements for Mines Act and Environmental Management Act Permits" and is intended for use in the development of both new and/or permit amendment applications. The information contained within the IRT will be developed to meet the unique nature of each project.

Aid MOE and MEM during the screening phase; inform clients of the detailed information required to support MA and EMA permit applications and ensure all the information necessary to support the MA and EMA applications is provided.

#### Joint Application Information Requirements for Mines Act and Environmental Management Act Permits

The Application Information Requirements document sets out the information that is required to support a joint application for a Mines Act (MA) permit issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and (if required) an effluent discharge permit issued under the Environmental Management Act (EMA) by the Ministry of Environment (MOE). This document is intended for both new and existing major mines, including proposed major expansions/extensions of mining projects. The combined technical information requirements are intended to reduce overlap in technical information required by both ministries and enable one application, or bundled applications, to be submitted for review.

### Synchronous Permitting

Synchronous permitting provides the same flexibility as the concurrent approval regulation for a coordinated EA and permit review process. Parties involved in the coordinated review process, however, are not bound by legislated timelines in order to make permitting decisions, post EA. Therefore, this option provides the time required to resolve potentially outstanding issues or substantial project changes that may arise during the coordinated review process. In addition, this option:

- Allows technical reviewers, who are typically the same members of the EA working group and the permitting advisory committee, the capacity to focus on the environmental assessment prior to the detailed permit review process;

- Provides proponents the time to address any significant issues that may require resolution during the EA, prior to finalizing their permit applications; and,
- Allows provincial statutory decision makers the time to identify where issues brought forward during the EA process may be appropriately addressed in permitting.

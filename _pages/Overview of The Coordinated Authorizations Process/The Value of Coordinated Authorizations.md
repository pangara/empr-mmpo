## The Value of Coordinated Authorizations

The coordinated authorizations process strives to reduce time, expense and risk while improving decisions. Streamlining and coordinating the permit application process provides benefits for proponents, First Nations, the public and the government.

**The Proponent** of a major mine will have a government project lead assigned to coordinate the review process. The project lead, with the assistance of the advisory committee, provides proponents with a more clear and concise understanding about application requirements. Proponents have the opportunity to bundle their applications into a single submission to gain efficiencies; these options are described below in detail.

**First Nations** are able to assess the project as a whole within a harmonized consultation process instead of having to respond to a series of piecemeal consultations.

**The Public**'s safety, environmental and economic interests are served by informed and durable decisions supported by a comprehensive review, including public review and comment period(s) during both the EA and permit review processes.

**Government** staff and resources are used more effectively and efficiently. Facilitated coordination of natural resource agencies can improve consistency of approach, reduce overlap and share expertise.

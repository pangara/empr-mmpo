After completing necessary baseline and assessment studies to adequately address identified issues and potential impacts and meet statutory information requirements, the proponent should submit an applications package that meets the application requirements identified in the pre-application stage.

Members of the advisory committee, specifically the technical advisors to the statutory decision makers for each authorization under review will, with the coordinating assistance of the project lead, screen the draft application.

As noted above, the application requirements document developed by the proponent and accepted by the permitting agencies will assist in the screening of the draft application to ensure that it is complete and sufficient for a full review by the committee. If the technical advisors on the committee are satisfied with the applications package, the SDM's from each ministry will refer the completed applications to the advisory committee to review, initiating the coordinated review of the applications package. The advisory committee strives to complete a review of all submitted applications in a timely way.

Should a draft application package not pass the initial screening phase of the coordinated review process, the proponent will be asked to make the necessary revisions, requested by members of the advisory committee, to the draft application package for re-submission.

Once an application package has been accepted into the review phase of the coordinated authorization process, the project lead will inform the proponent that the draft applications for statutory authorizations has been screened and accepted for review. The proponent is responsible for distributing the final application and supporting documentation to advisory committee members and making it available to the public and other interest groups. Electronic distribution is encouraged where practicable and where it meets the needs of all reviewers; however, at least one hard copy is still required for EMPR.

The proponent will be asked to meet with the MRC early in the application review stage to summarize the content of the applications and help kick-start the review. The advisory committee provides the interagency and First Nations venue for technical review of the applications and for information exchange and discussions among all committee participants. The proponent will be expected to address all issues within the scope of review before the final report of the committee is forwarded to statutory decision makers. The project lead will work with the advisory committee and proponent to find homes for addressing any issues which are outside the scope of the statutory authorizations under review.

The goal of the project lead and other advisory committee members is to work collaboratively and strive to complete the application review stage in a timely manner.

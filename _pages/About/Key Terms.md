## Key Terms

**Advisory Committee,** in this guide, refers to a committee that is established by the Chief Inspector of Mines for a specific mine project. The committee comprised of provincial government agencies and First Nations serves as the primary forum for the coordinated authorizations process. The committee satisfies the requirement under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_ to act as a regional advisory committee specific to the major mine project under review.

**Authorizations** are permits, licences or approvals for activities required by legislation. This guide focuses on the authorizations required for the construction, operation and closure of a major mine.

**Code** in this guide is the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia established under the _Mines Act_.

**Coordinated Authorizations Process** is a process implemented largely through a project-specific advisory committee to coordinate multiple authorizations that may be required from the various Provincial natural resource agencies for new or expanded major mine projects.

**Major mine project** , for the purposes of this guide, is a major mine project which the Chief Inspector of Mines has referred to the coordinated authorizations process.

**Mine Development Review Committees (MDRCs)** and **Mine Review Committees (MRCs)** are interagency advisory committees established under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_ to review applications for authorizations under the _Mines Act_ referred to them by the Chief Inspector of Mines, and to make recommendations to the Chief Inspector and other statutory decision makers. In the context of the coordinated authorizations process, an MDRC and/or MRC provide a single window interagency venue for prospective major mine proponents who may enter the coordinated authorization process, to establish communication with natural resource sector ministries.

## Preface

This document is intended to outline the content of the MMPO E-guide; an online repository of current information including instructions, templates, documents and examples supporting the work of MMPO Project Leads. It connects the coordinated authorization process to project management best practices and follows the workflow of a Project Lead from pre-application activities through application screening, technical review, draft permits to decision by statutory decision makers.

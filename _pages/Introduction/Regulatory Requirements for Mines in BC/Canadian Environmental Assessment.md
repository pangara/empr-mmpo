### Canadian Environmental Assessment

The _Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012_ applies to any mine project that is captured by the Regulations Designating Physical Activities. The proponent of such a project is required to submit a project description to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, who determines if a federal EA is required based on the potential for environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction. If a federal environmental assessment is required for a mine project, the assessment is undertaken by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.

The EAO and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency have signed a memorandum of understanding on substitution to achieve the principle of "one project, one assessment" in practice. Under substitution, where both federal and provincial EA's are required, there can be a single review process (provincial) and two decisions (federal and provincial). Substitution is considered on a project by project basis.

More information is available at: [http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/](http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/) and [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/substitution.html](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/substitution.html). A public engagement process on potential changes to the federal EA process was initiated in 2016. Proponents should confirm whether there have been any updates to the federal legislation prior to pursuing regulatory approvals for their project.

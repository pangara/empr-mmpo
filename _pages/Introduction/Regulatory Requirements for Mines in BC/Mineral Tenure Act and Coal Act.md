### Mineral Tenure Act and Coal Act

The Mineral Titles office of EMPR administers the _Mineral Tenure Act_ and the _Coal Act_, and manages the recording system for the acquisition and maintenance of mineral and coal tenures in BC.

Under the _Mineral Tenure Act_, a mineral claim must be converted to a mining lease for any production exceeding 1,000 tonnes of ore per year from each unit or cell.

Under the _Coal Act_, production of coal from a coal license is limited to a single 100,000 tonne sample for testing purposes. Coal licenses must be converted to coal leases for production above the limit.

### BC Environmental Assessment

The Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) is a provincial agency that manages the review of proposed major projects in British Columbia, as required by the _Environmental Assessment Act._ This integrated review process identifies and evaluates the potential adverse environmental, economic, social, heritage, and health effects that may occur during the life of a reviewable project. The neutrally administered process is transparent, timely, and procedurally fair, holding all participants accountable. Opportunities for meaningful participation in the EAO process are available to First Nations, proponents, the public, local governments, and federal and provincial agencies.

If a project is reviewable under the _Environmental Assessment Act_, a proponent must obtain an EA certificate before subsequent authorizations can be issued for the project. An EA certificate is the legal instrument to address and mitigate the potential economic, environmental, heritage, health or social effects including potential adverse effects to Aboriginal Interests from the proposed mine that were identified through the EA. The certificate also defines how and where the project must be constructed and operated through the attached certified project description and table of conditions. Subsequent permits must be consistent with the project described in the EA certificate or they are without effect.

Where a project is also subject to a Federal environmental assessment, the EAO is committed to working with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to minimize duplication and to harmonize efforts wherever possible.

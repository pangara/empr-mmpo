### Environmental Management Act

In addition to the _Mines Act_ permit, a permit to discharge effluent under the _Environmental Management Act_ is an essential authorization for any activity on a mine that could result in a discharge to the environment and for the management of waste. A permit authorizes the discharge of wastes from the mining activity to the environment and sets the terms and conditions under which the discharge may occur so that pollution is prevented. The terms and conditions include limiting the quantity and quality of waste contaminants, monitoring the discharge in the receiving environment, and reporting information to the Ministry of Environment. Permits are ongoing authorizations and may be amended, transferred to other dischargers, suspended or cancelled.

The _Environmental Management Act_ permit application can seek authorization for a major mine's construction stage (erosion and sediment control) and the operations stage (metal and chemical residues, contact water and tailings).

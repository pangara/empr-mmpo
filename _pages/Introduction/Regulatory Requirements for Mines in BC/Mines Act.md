### Mines Act

The CIM is the senior SDM for all mines in the Province under the authority of the _Mines Act_ and Code. Under Section 10 of the _Mines Act_, the owner, agent or manager of a mine must hold a permit issued by the CIM before starting any work in, on or about the mine. A _Mine Act_ permit does not expire and can only be closed by the CIM once the reclamation obligations have been satisfactorily fulfilled.

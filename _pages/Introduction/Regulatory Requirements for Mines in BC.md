## Regulatory Requirements for Mines in BC

This section identifies statutory requirements corresponding to the development stages defined in the previous section, outlined in bold. Each requirement will have triggers and processes specified in legislation and/or policy.

The purpose of the figure below is to illustrate the potential number of authorizations and the general timing of requirements throughout the life of a mine. Note that there are a number of authorization requirements outside of the coordinated authorization review process.

Although this guide cites specific legislation, government policies and other documentation, users should be aware that some of the legislation, policies and documents cited are subject to review and change. Users should therefore refer to official copies of the legislation, and should contact the appropriate government offices directly to determine legal requirements and confirm that they are referencing the most up to date policies and documentation.

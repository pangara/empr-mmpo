## Regulatory Requirements for Mines in BC

This section identifies statutory requirements corresponding to the development stages defined in the previous section, outlined in bold. Each requirement will have triggers and processes specified in legislation and/or policy.

The purpose of the figure below is to illustrate the potential number of authorizations and the general timing of requirements throughout the life of a mine. Note that there are a number of authorization requirements outside of the coordinated authorization review process.

Although this guide cites specific legislation, government policies and other documentation, users should be aware that some of the legislation, policies and documents cited are subject to review and change. Users should therefore refer to official copies of the legislation, and should contact the appropriate government offices directly to determine legal requirements and confirm that they are referencing the most up to date policies and documentation.

### Mineral Tenure Act and Coal Act
---

The Mineral Titles office of EMPR administers the _Mineral Tenure Act_ and the _Coal Act_, and manages the recording system for the acquisition and maintenance of mineral and coal tenures in BC.

Under the _Mineral Tenure Act_, a mineral claim must be converted to a mining lease for any production exceeding 1,000 tonnes of ore per year from each unit or cell.

Under the _Coal Act_, production of coal from a coal license is limited to a single 100,000 tonne sample for testing purposes. Coal licenses must be converted to coal leases for production above the limit.

### BC Environmental Assessment
---

The Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) is a provincial agency that manages the review of proposed major projects in British Columbia, as required by the _Environmental Assessment Act._ This integrated review process identifies and evaluates the potential adverse environmental, economic, social, heritage, and health effects that may occur during the life of a reviewable project. The neutrally administered process is transparent, timely, and procedurally fair, holding all participants accountable. Opportunities for meaningful participation in the EAO process are available to First Nations, proponents, the public, local governments, and federal and provincial agencies.

If a project is reviewable under the _Environmental Assessment Act_, a proponent must obtain an EA certificate before subsequent authorizations can be issued for the project. An EA certificate is the legal instrument to address and mitigate the potential economic, environmental, heritage, health or social effects including potential adverse effects to Aboriginal Interests from the proposed mine that were identified through the EA. The certificate also defines how and where the project must be constructed and operated through the attached certified project description and table of conditions. Subsequent permits must be consistent with the project described in the EA certificate or they are without effect.

Where a project is also subject to a Federal environmental assessment, the EAO is committed to working with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to minimize duplication and to harmonize efforts wherever possible.

For more information about the environmental assessment process, refer to the [EAO User Guide](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/pdf/EAO_User_Guide_20100415.pdf) and other information on the EAO website: [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/).

### Canadian Environmental Assessment
---

The _Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012_ applies to any mine project that is captured by the Regulations Designating Physical Activities. The proponent of such a project is required to submit a project description to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, who determines if a federal EA is required based on the potential for environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction. If a federal environmental assessment is required for a mine project, the assessment is undertaken by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.

The EAO and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency have signed a memorandum of understanding on substitution to achieve the principle of "one project, one assessment" in practice. Under substitution, where both federal and provincial EA's are required, there can be a single review process (provincial) and two decisions (federal and provincial). Substitution is considered on a project by project basis.

More information is available at: [http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/](http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/) and [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/substitution.html](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/substitution.html). A public engagement process on potential changes to the federal EA process was initiated in 2016. Proponents should confirm whether there have been any updates to the federal legislation prior to pursuing regulatory approvals for their project.

### Mines Act
---

The CIM is the senior SDM for all mines in the Province under the authority of the _Mines Act_ and Code. Under Section 10 of the _Mines Act_, the owner, agent or manager of a mine must hold a permit issued by the CIM before starting any work in, on or about the mine. A _Mine Act_ permit does not expire and can only be closed by the CIM once the reclamation obligations have been satisfactorily fulfilled.

### Environmental Management Act
---

In addition to the _Mines Act_ permit, a permit to discharge effluent under the _Environmental Management Act_ is an essential authorization for any activity on a mine that could result in a discharge to the environment and for the management of waste. A permit authorizes the discharge of wastes from the mining activity to the environment and sets the terms and conditions under which the discharge may occur so that pollution is prevented. The terms and conditions include limiting the quantity and quality of waste contaminants, monitoring the discharge in the receiving environment, and reporting information to the Ministry of Environment. Permits are ongoing authorizations and may be amended, transferred to other dischargers, suspended or cancelled.

The _Environmental Management Act_ permit application can seek authorization for a major mine's construction stage (erosion and sediment control) and the operations stage (metal and chemical residues, contact water and tailings).

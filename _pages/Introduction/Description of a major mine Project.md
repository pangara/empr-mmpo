## Description of a major mine Project

For the purposes of the coordinated authorizations process, a major mine project refers to any new or existing mine which requires multiple authorizations and has been referred to the coordinated authorizations process by the Chief Inspector of Mines. There are three different ways for a major mine project to come into the coordinated authorizations process:

- a new major mine project proceeding from the provincial environmental assessment process under the _Environmental Assessment Act_ (EAA);
- a new major mine project that is non-reviewable under the EAA; or
- a major mine project that is an extension, expansion or re-start requiring multiple authorization amendments.

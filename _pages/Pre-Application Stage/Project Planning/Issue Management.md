### Issue Management

Project Leads manage two types of issues throughout each stage of the project, technical issues and project issues. Technical Issues are generated by the MRC and are the responsibility of the proponent to resolve while project issues can be generated by anyone and impact the deliverables or milestones of the project.

Issue Management involves the implementation of five key processes:

- The identification of project issues
- The evaluation and documentation of project issues
- The determination of issue resolution actions
- The monitoring and control of assigned issue resolution actions
- The closure of project issues.

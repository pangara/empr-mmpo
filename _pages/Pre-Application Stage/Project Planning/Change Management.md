### Change Management

Project Leads are responsible for identifying change within the project. When a valid change is identified the Project Lead will work with the Proponent, the PMC and members of the MRC to initiate the change management process with the completion of a change request form. The change request form details the impact on the schedule, change level, and benefits/costs of the proposed change. The Project Lead will review level 1 changes for approval and forward level 2 and 3 changes to the appropriate approval level. Once a change is reviewed and approved, the Project Lead will record the change into the Change Management Log and revise the permit schedule. If the change is rejected, the change request will be recorded in the change log as rejected.

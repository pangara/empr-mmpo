### Baseline Schedule

The purpose of the baseline Schedule is to identify initial timelines for project milestones, activities and deliverables. Project schedules are developed, revised and maintained by MMPO Project Leads.

Steps to New Schedule Development:

1. New schedules are drafted by Project Leads using input from the proponent and members of the MRC.
2. The Project Management Centre (PMC) offers advice on the workloads of project resources over the timeline of the draft permit schedule.
3. The Project Lead revises the draft permit based on the advice of the PMC
4. The revised draft of the schedule then is shared with members of the MRC for feedback.
5. The Project lead develops the final draft of the permit schedule using the feedback of the members of the MRC.
6. The Project Director then takes the final draft permit schedule to the Chief Inspectors Office (CIO) for approval.
7. Final draft permit schedules approved by the CIO are then sent to the Major Mine Permitting Board for final approval.
8. Once new permit schedules are approved by the Board they are considered the baseline schedule for the project.

### Project Charter

The purpose of this Project Charter is to provide a shared understanding of the coordinated authorization process for Major Mine Projects as it applies to each Project. The Project Charter also outlines the scope and objectives of the process, major risks and the roles and responsibilities of all Project Stakeholders and First Nations.

A Project Charter is developed at the outset of the coordinated authorizations process by a designated Project Lead with input from the Proponent and Project participants. Once complete the Project Charter will approved by the Project Director before going to the Major Mine Project Board for approval. The Project Charter is updated as necessary when elements within the Charter change.

- To provide a shared understanding of how permit applications for a project are managed through the coordinated authorization process.
- To set the scope and objectives for the coordinated authorizations process for a project.
- To provide the proponent and the province with background on the project and First Nations engagement.
- To provide roles and responsibilities and an organizational chart for participants managing permit applications through the coordinated authorization process.
- To outline major deliverables and milestones of the coordinated authorizations process.
- To provide a communication plan outlining the reports and meetings included as part of the coordinated authorizations process.

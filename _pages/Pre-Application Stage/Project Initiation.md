## Project Initiation

### Mine Review Advisory Committees
---

Under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_, the CIM has the authority to establish an advisory committee; in the context of the coordinated authorization process, the CIM will delegate a representative from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources to chair the advisory committee on his/her behalf for the review of applications for mine approvals and permits.

At the discretion of the CIM or delegated authority, the project may be referred to a Regional Mine Development Review Committee (MDRC) or a project-specific Mine Review Committee (MRC). The criteria considered by the CIM in determining the appropriate venue for review includes but is not limited to the scope, scale, and complexity of the project proposal.

In the context of the coordinated authorizations process, both the MDRCs and project-specific MRCs provide a single interagency venue for mine proponents to engage in pre-application discussions with natural resource sector agencies and First Nations. This gives proponents an early look at the review process, application information requirements, and responsibilities of all parties involved throughout the coordinated review process.

### Early Engagement With Proponent
---

#### Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Outreach

The initial contact by major mine proponents to the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources should be to the office of the CIM who will refer the proponent to the appropriate branch within the Ministry, assigning a project lead and establish an advisory committee. The project lead assigned to the file will assist in the early conversations and the beginning of the pre-application stage to ensure that the project proposal is understood, the coordinated authorizations process is discussed and a preliminary identification of issues and next steps are undertaken.

Early outreach using the advisory committee can assist in the identification and scoping of issues and information requirements in advance of the coordinated authorizations process. Strong relationships, a collaborative information-gathering process and detailed understanding of the potential impacts and benefits of the project at this stage will give parties greater confidence for moving forward.

#### Project Description

For the review of large scale major mine projects, the CIM will typically assign the file to the Major Mine Permitting Office. MMPO will then assign a project lead that will develop the project specific Mine Review Committee and arrange the first committee meeting. At this meeting, the proponent will introduce their project to committee members and provide the proposed project description and related information, enabling the committee to:

- identify project components and activities both onsite and offsite;
- identify with the proponent the list of potential Provincial statutory authorizations to be reviewed by the committee;
- identify the baseline and impact assessment information requirements to satisfy the authorization applications;
- identify potential issues related to the project proposal including identifying homes for addressing issues which may be outside the scope of statutory permit ability to address, and,
- develop the engagement and consultation approach to meeting the government's duty to consult and accommodate First Nations.

The project description should be based on an understanding of the coordinated authorizations approach to bundling authorization applications to provide for efficient and effective consultation with First Nations and to enable a review of the project as a whole.

If the major mine proposal is proceeding from the provincial environmental assessment process, the proponent will have already prepared a project description that can be updated and expanded as necessary for the committee.

#### Public Outreach

Proponent-sponsored outreach to the public during project initiation can also contribute to an efficient review process by informing the public and providing the proponent with early identification of public issues and information requirements.

Major mine project proponents will ultimately need to engage with the public during both the environmental assessment and permit review processes (refer to Section 4.3.2 _Public Review and Comment_ for further details). Public participation in a project review process helps to ensure that community values and public goals for community development are considered in project planning and decision-making. Throughout the project process, it is the proponent's responsibility to provide opportunities for public comment on the project often through open houses and comment periods. It is fundamental to good development that members of the public have an opportunity to review and comment on plans before they are approved. In addition to providing a means of identifying and mitigating potential problems within the project, public consultation also offers the opportunity for developers to become familiar with the social and political fabric of the surrounding community.

### Early Engagement and Consultation With First Nations
---

The legal responsibility to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate, lies with the Crown alone, as represented by the statutory decision makers. Project proponents can, however, be of great assistance in building relationships with First Nations and facilitating the exchange of information.

For pre-application engagement, Provincial staff can provide advice to proponents based on a scan of Aboriginal interests in the area. Before commencing consultation, Provincial staff will conduct an initial review as described in the Provincial Procedures and establish an initial level of engagement/consultation. This will include reviewing First Nations contacts and other related readily available information, including general archeological and historical information. This is also an opportunity for government to clarify any protocols contained in agreements with First Nations. If pre-application information sharing has taken place between the Proponent and First Nations, the Province will also review the findings from this early engagement.

First Nations engagement by the major mine proponent and consultation by the Province occurs throughout a mine's development, starting from the exploration stage. Planning for First Nations consultation at the coordinated authorizations stage will be in the context of the previous consultations and the previous knowledge and relationships that the Province and proponent have with the First Nations.

The proponent is advised to engage with all potentially affected First Nations in meaningful and collaborative dialogue and relationship building, and to gain an understanding of the potential impacts of the project and the First Nations' expectations for participation in the project.

Some key issues that will likely be of interest to potentially affected First Nations include:

- wildlife and fisheries harvest activities in the area;
- water quality;
- other traditional use activity (sustenance activities, village sites, spiritual sites, etc.);
- archaeology sites;
- socio-economic impacts, and
- capacity to participate in consultation and benefit sharing including jobs and contract opportunities.

Any joint studies with First Nations that provide ethnographic or legal information about the Aboriginal claims (to Aboriginal rights and/or title) in the area and/or the impact of the proposed activity on First Nations will also be of significant value.

Many First Nations will have the internal capacity, or want to develop the internal capacity, to take on a direct role in the collection of the information required by the proponent. Proponents are encouraged to involve First Nations in the collection of information as much as possible, as this is an opportunity to contribute to capacity building and to help First Nations develop a stronger understanding of the project impacts and benefits.

It should be noted that the proponent is not required to provide government with First Nations information that by arrangement with First Nations has been agreed to be treated as confidential.

Project proponents may assist Provincial staff by advising of any engagement activities with First Nations such as providing mitigation strategies, environmental monitoring or benefit sharing opportunities. Commitments to training programs, employment opportunities or other engagements by the proponent will help secure longer-term relationships with the mining sector in the area and build the capacity for engagement on other projects.

If the proponent's discussions with First Nations have extended to cover proposed statutory authorizations, it will be of particular value to the advisory committee to be aware of any mitigation strategies that have been proposed (such as providing a role for First Nations in the environmental monitoring or reclamation). If such strategies have not been identified, the proponent may seek assistance from the advisory committee at a later stage in the consultation process to secure such longer term commitments, where appropriate, in discussions with the First Nations.

Proponents are encouraged to refer to the additional information regarding engagement with First Nations, including utilizing all of the guidance and resources provided on the following BC Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation webpage: [http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/consultation/index.html](http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/consultation/index.html).

### Strategic Agreements With First Nations
---

The Province of British Columbia is committed to establishing processes and institutions for shared decision-making about the land and resources and for revenue and benefit sharing with First Nations. Treaties and other agreements are important tools for First Nations to develop sustainable, healthy, and resilient communities. These agreements help build relationships with First Nations, resolve conflicts, or address concerns associated with development on traditional territories. Both treaties and non-treaty agreements are key aspects of this government's vision for a strong economy and secure future for all British Columbians.

### Land Use Planning
---

Provincial land use plans provide the framework and context for setting environmental, social, land use and resource management goals and objectives on Crown land. For some authorizations, land use plans establish legal objectives and policy that decision-makers must consider. Land use plans may also describe considerations relevant to engagement with First Nations and may be the basis for First Nations involvement in the authorizations process. As such, land use plans may inform the authorizations process.

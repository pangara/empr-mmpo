### Early Engagement and Consultation With First Nations

The legal responsibility to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate, lies with the Crown alone, as represented by the statutory decision makers. Project proponents can, however, be of great assistance in building relationships with First Nations and facilitating the exchange of information.

For pre-application engagement, Provincial staff can provide advice to proponents based on a scan of Aboriginal interests in the area. Before commencing consultation, Provincial staff will conduct an initial review as described in the Provincial Procedures and establish an initial level of engagement/consultation. This will include reviewing First Nations contacts and other related readily available information, including general archeological and historical information. This is also an opportunity for government to clarify any protocols contained in agreements with First Nations. If pre-application information sharing has taken place between the Proponent and First Nations, the Province will also review the findings from this early engagement.

First Nations engagement by the major mine proponent and consultation by the Province occurs throughout a mine's development, starting from the exploration stage. Planning for First Nations consultation at the coordinated authorizations stage will be in the context of the previous consultations and the previous knowledge and relationships that the Province and proponent have with the First Nations.

The proponent is advised to engage with all potentially affected First Nations in meaningful and collaborative dialogue and relationship building, and to gain an understanding of the potential impacts of the project and the First Nations' expectations for participation in the project.

Some key issues that will likely be of interest to potentially affected First Nations include:

- wildlife and fisheries harvest activities in the area;
- water quality;
- other traditional use activity (sustenance activities, village sites, spiritual sites, etc.);
- archaeology sites;
- socio-economic impacts, and
- capacity to participate in consultation and benefit sharing including jobs and contract opportunities.

Any joint studies with First Nations that provide ethnographic or legal information about the Aboriginal claims (to Aboriginal rights and/or title) in the area and/or the impact of the proposed activity on First Nations will also be of significant value.

Many First Nations will have the internal capacity, or want to develop the internal capacity, to take on a direct role in the collection of the information required by the proponent. Proponents are encouraged to involve First Nations in the collection of information as much as possible, as this is an opportunity to contribute to capacity building and to help First Nations develop a stronger understanding of the project impacts and benefits.

It should be noted that the proponent is not required to provide government with First Nations information that by arrangement with First Nations has been agreed to be treated as confidential.

Project proponents may assist Provincial staff by advising of any engagement activities with First Nations such as providing mitigation strategies, environmental monitoring or benefit sharing opportunities. Commitments to training programs, employment opportunities or other engagements by the proponent will help secure longer-term relationships with the mining sector in the area and build the capacity for engagement on other projects.

If the proponent's discussions with First Nations have extended to cover proposed statutory authorizations, it will be of particular value to the advisory committee to be aware of any mitigation strategies that have been proposed (such as providing a role for First Nations in the environmental monitoring or reclamation). If such strategies have not been identified, the proponent may seek assistance from the advisory committee at a later stage in the consultation process to secure such longer term commitments, where appropriate, in discussions with the First Nations.

Proponents are encouraged to refer to the additional information regarding engagement with First Nations, including utilizing all of the guidance and resources provided on the following BC Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation webpage: [http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/consultation/index.html](http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/consultation/index.html).

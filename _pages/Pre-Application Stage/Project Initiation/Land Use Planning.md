### Land Use Planning

Provincial land use plans provide the framework and context for setting environmental, social, land use and resource management goals and objectives on Crown land. For some authorizations, land use plans establish legal objectives and policy that decision-makers must consider. Land use plans may also describe considerations relevant to engagement with First Nations and may be the basis for First Nations involvement in the authorizations process. As such, land use plans may inform the authorizations process.

### Mine Review Advisory Committees

Under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_, the CIM has the authority to establish an advisory committee; in the context of the coordinated authorization process, the CIM will delegate a representative from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources to chair the advisory committee on his/her behalf for the review of applications for mine approvals and permits.

At the discretion of the CIM or delegated authority, the project may be referred to a Regional Mine Development Review Committee (MDRC) or a project-specific Mine Review Committee (MRC). The criteria considered by the CIM in determining the appropriate venue for review includes but is not limited to the scope, scale, and complexity of the project proposal.

In the context of the coordinated authorizations process, both the MDRCs and project-specific MRCs provide a single interagency venue for mine proponents to engage in pre-application discussions with natural resource sector agencies and First Nations. This gives proponents an early look at the review process, application information requirements, and responsibilities of all parties involved throughout the coordinated review process.

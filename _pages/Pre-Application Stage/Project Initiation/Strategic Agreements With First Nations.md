### Strategic Agreements With First Nations

The Province of British Columbia is committed to establishing processes and institutions for shared decision-making about the land and resources and for revenue and benefit sharing with First Nations. Treaties and other agreements are important tools for First Nations to develop sustainable, healthy, and resilient communities. These agreements help build relationships with First Nations, resolve conflicts, or address concerns associated with development on traditional territories. Both treaties and non-treaty agreements are key aspects of this government's vision for a strong economy and secure future for all British Columbians.

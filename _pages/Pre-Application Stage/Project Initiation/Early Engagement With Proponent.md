### Early Engagement With Proponent

#### Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Outreach

The initial contact by major mine proponents to the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources should be to the office of the CIM who will refer the proponent to the appropriate branch within the Ministry, assigning a project lead and establish an advisory committee. The project lead assigned to the file will assist in the early conversations and the beginning of the pre-application stage to ensure that the project proposal is understood, the coordinated authorizations process is discussed and a preliminary identification of issues and next steps are undertaken.

Early outreach using the advisory committee can assist in the identification and scoping of issues and information requirements in advance of the coordinated authorizations process. Strong relationships, a collaborative information-gathering process and detailed understanding of the potential impacts and benefits of the project at this stage will give parties greater confidence for moving forward.

#### Project Description

For the review of large scale major mine projects, the CIM will typically assign the file to the Major Mine Permitting Office. MMPO will then assign a project lead that will develop the project specific Mine Review Committee and arrange the first committee meeting. At this meeting, the proponent will introduce their project to committee members and provide the proposed project description and related information, enabling the committee to:

- identify project components and activities both onsite and offsite;
- identify with the proponent the list of potential Provincial statutory authorizations to be reviewed by the committee;
- identify the baseline and impact assessment information requirements to satisfy the authorization applications;
- identify potential issues related to the project proposal including identifying homes for addressing issues which may be outside the scope of statutory permit ability to address, and,
- develop the engagement and consultation approach to meeting the government's duty to consult and accommodate First Nations.

The project description should be based on an understanding of the coordinated authorizations approach to bundling authorization applications to provide for efficient and effective consultation with First Nations and to enable a review of the project as a whole.

If the major mine proposal is proceeding from the provincial environmental assessment process, the proponent will have already prepared a project description that can be updated and expanded as necessary for the committee.

#### Public Outreach

Proponent-sponsored outreach to the public during project initiation can also contribute to an efficient review process by informing the public and providing the proponent with early identification of public issues and information requirements.

Major mine project proponents will ultimately need to engage with the public during both the environmental assessment and permit review processes (refer to Section 4.3.2 _Public Review and Comment_ for further details). Public participation in a project review process helps to ensure that community values and public goals for community development are considered in project planning and decision-making. Throughout the project process, it is the proponent's responsibility to provide opportunities for public comment on the project often through open houses and comment periods. It is fundamental to good development that members of the public have an opportunity to review and comment on plans before they are approved. In addition to providing a means of identifying and mitigating potential problems within the project, public consultation also offers the opportunity for developers to become familiar with the social and political fabric of the surrounding community.

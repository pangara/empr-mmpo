## 3. Key Terms

**Advisory Committee,** in this guide, refers to a committee that is established by the Chief Inspector of Mines for a specific mine project. The committee comprised of provincial government agencies and First Nations serves as the primary forum for the coordinated authorizations process. The committee satisfies the requirement under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_ to act as a regional advisory committee specific to the major mine project under review.

**Authorizations** are permits, licences or approvals for activities required by legislation. This guide focuses on the authorizations required for the construction, operation and closure of a major mine.

**Code** in this guide is the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia established under the _Mines Act_.

**Coordinated Authorizations Process** is a process implemented largely through a project-specific advisory committee to coordinate multiple authorizations that may be required from the various Provincial natural resource agencies for new or expanded major mine projects.

**Major mine project** , for the purposes of this guide, is a major mine project which the Chief Inspector of Mines has referred to the coordinated authorizations process.

**Mine Development Review Committees (MDRCs)** and **Mine Review Committees (MRCs)** are interagency advisory committees established under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_ to review applications for authorizations under the _Mines Act_ referred to them by the Chief Inspector of Mines, and to make recommendations to the Chief Inspector and other statutory decision makers. In the context of the coordinated authorizations process, an MDRC and/or MRC provide a single window interagency venue for prospective major mine proponents who may enter the coordinated authorization process, to establish communication with natural resource sector ministries.

**Project Lead** is the individual assigned by EMPR to lead and manage the coordinated authorizations process for a major mine project, referred by the Chief Inspector of Mines.

**Proponent** is the applicant or holder of a mineral or coal tenure who proposes to construct or modify and operate a major mine project.

**Tenure** with respect to major mine projects means mineral claims and leases under the _Mineral Tenure Act_ and coal licenses and leases under the _Coal Act_.

# 2. Introduction

The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (EMPR) leads the coordinated authorizations review process in collaboration with provincial natural resource sector (NRS) agencies and with First Nations, to streamline permitting decisions to encourage economic development while striving to better understand and manage potential impacts to environmental, social, and cultural values.

## 1. Description of a major mine Project

For the purposes of the coordinated authorizations process, a major mine project refers to any new or existing mine which requires multiple authorizations and has been referred to the coordinated authorizations process by the Chief Inspector of Mines. There are three different ways for a major mine project to come into the coordinated authorizations process:

- a new major mine project proceeding from the provincial environmental assessment process under the _Environmental Assessment Act_ (EAA);
- a new major mine project that is non-reviewable under the EAA; or
- a major mine project that is an extension, expansion or re-start requiring multiple authorization amendments.

## 2. Chief Inspector Of Mines

The Chief Inspector of Mines (CIM) is appointed by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources to administer the _Mines Act_ and the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia_._ The CIM is also the Executive Director of the Mines and Mineral Resources Division's Health and Safety Branch.

The CIM is the senior statutory decision maker (SDM) for all mines in BC and is the primary contact for major mine permits. The CIM is also the initial point of intake for applications for major mine permits and amendments.

The CIM has the statutory authority and obligation to establish an advisory committee to review applications for _Mines Act_ permits.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements for Mines in BC

This section identifies statutory requirements corresponding to the development stages defined in the previous section, outlined in bold. Each requirement will have triggers and processes specified in legislation and/or policy.

The purpose of the figure below is to illustrate the potential number of authorizations and the general timing of requirements throughout the life of a mine. Note that there are a number of authorization requirements outside of the coordinated authorization review process.

Although this guide cites specific legislation, government policies and other documentation, users should be aware that some of the legislation, policies and documents cited are subject to review and change. Users should therefore refer to official copies of the legislation, and should contact the appropriate government offices directly to determine legal requirements and confirm that they are referencing the most up to date policies and documentation.

**Figure 3 - Regulatory Framework for Major Mines**

### i. Mineral Tenure Act and Coal Act

The Mineral Titles office of EMPR administers the _Mineral Tenure Act_ and the _Coal Act_, and manages the recording system for the acquisition and maintenance of mineral and coal tenures in BC.

Under the _Mineral Tenure Act_, a mineral claim must be converted to a mining lease for any production exceeding 1,000 tonnes of ore per year from each unit or cell.

Under the _Coal Act_, production of coal from a coal license is limited to a single 100,000 tonne sample for testing purposes. Coal licenses must be converted to coal leases for production above the limit.

For more information on the EMPR, Mineral Titles Branch please visit: [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/mineral-titles](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/mineral-titles).

### ii. BC Environmental Assessment

The Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) is a provincial agency that manages the review of proposed major projects in British Columbia, as required by the _Environmental Assessment Act._ This integrated review process identifies and evaluates the potential adverse environmental, economic, social, heritage, and health effects that may occur during the life of a reviewable project. The neutrally administered process is transparent, timely, and procedurally fair, holding all participants accountable. Opportunities for meaningful participation in the EAO process are available to First Nations, proponents, the public, local governments, and federal and provincial agencies.

If a project is reviewable under the _Environmental Assessment Act_, a proponent must obtain an EA certificate before subsequent authorizations can be issued for the project. An EA certificate is the legal instrument to address and mitigate the potential economic, environmental, heritage, health or social effects including potential adverse effects to Aboriginal Interests from the proposed mine that were identified through the EA. The certificate also defines how and where the project must be constructed and operated through the attached certified project description and table of conditions. Subsequent permits must be consistent with the project described in the EA certificate or they are without effect.

Where a project is also subject to a Federal environmental assessment, the EAO is committed to working with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to minimize duplication and to harmonize efforts wherever possible.

For more information about the environmental assessment process, refer to the [EAO User Guide](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/pdf/EAO_User_Guide_20100415.pdf) and other information on the EAO website: [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/).

### iii. Canadian Environmental Assessment

The _Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012_ applies to any mine project that is captured by the Regulations Designating Physical Activities. The proponent of such a project is required to submit a project description to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, who determines if a federal EA is required based on the potential for environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction. If a federal environmental assessment is required for a mine project, the assessment is undertaken by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.

The EAO and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency have signed a memorandum of understanding on substitution to achieve the principle of "one project, one assessment" in practice. Under substitution, where both federal and provincial EA's are required, there can be a single review process (provincial) and two decisions (federal and provincial). Substitution is considered on a project by project basis.

More information is available at: [http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/](http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/) and [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/substitution.html](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/substitution.html). A public engagement process on potential changes to the federal EA process was initiated in 2016. Proponents should confirm whether there have been any updates to the federal legislation prior to pursuing regulatory approvals for their project.

### iv. Mines Act

The CIM is the senior SDM for all mines in the Province under the authority of the _Mines Act_ and Code. Under Section 10 of the _Mines Act_, the owner, agent or manager of a mine must hold a permit issued by the CIM before starting any work in, on or about the mine. A _Mine Act_ permit does not expire and can only be closed by the CIM once the reclamation obligations have been satisfactorily fulfilled.

Line to Mines Act

### v. Environmental Management Act

In addition to the _Mines Act_ permit, a permit to discharge effluent under the _Environmental Management Act_ is an essential authorization for any activity on a mine that could result in a discharge to the environment and for the management of waste. A permit authorizes the discharge of wastes from the mining activity to the environment and sets the terms and conditions under which the discharge may occur so that pollution is prevented. The terms and conditions include limiting the quantity and quality of waste contaminants, monitoring the discharge in the receiving environment, and reporting information to the Ministry of Environment. Permits are ongoing authorizations and may be amended, transferred to other dischargers, suspended or cancelled.

The _Environmental Management Act_ permit application can seek authorization for a major mine's construction stage (erosion and sediment control) and the operations stage (metal and chemical residues, contact water and tailings).

# 3. Overview of The Coordinated Authorizations Process

Once a major mine project advances to a stage where multiple authorizations are required, the CIM may establish a project-specific advisory committee to coordinate and review the applications and provide advice to Provincial statutory decision makers (SDMs). Further, the CIM may request that MMPO chair the advisory committee. Once the advisory committee is established, MMPO assigns a project lead to manage the coordinated review process.

The goal of the coordinated authorizations process is to coordinate the review of multiple authorizations including both technical and First Nations consultation and accommodation conversations required from the various natural resource agencies for new and expanding major mines.

The coordinated authorization process is meant to improve consistency and eliminate overlap and duplication in process and information requirements by the various natural resource agencies. The advisory committee provides recommendations through their technical review; statutory decision makers within each natural resource agency maintain responsibility for their respective individual permitting decisions.

## 1. The Value of Coordinated Authorizations

The coordinated authorizations process strives to reduce time, expense and risk while improving decisions. Streamlining and coordinating the permit application process provides benefits for proponents, First Nations, the public and the government.

**The Proponent** of a major mine will have a government project lead assigned to coordinate the review process. The project lead, with the assistance of the advisory committee, provides proponents with a more clear and concise understanding about application requirements. Proponents have the opportunity to bundle their applications into a single submission to gain efficiencies; these options are described below in detail.

**First Nations** are able to assess the project as a whole within a harmonized consultation process instead of having to respond to a series of piecemeal consultations.

**The Public**'s safety, environmental and economic interests are served by informed and durable decisions supported by a comprehensive review, including public review and comment period(s) during both the EA and permit review processes.

**Government** staff and resources are used more effectively and efficiently. Facilitated coordination of natural resource agencies can improve consistency of approach, reduce overlap and share expertise.

### i. Concurrent Approval Regulation

The _Environmental Assessment Act_ Concurrent Approval Regulation allows proponents to apply for the concurrent review of provincial authorizations for a proposed project that is undergoing the EA process.

The Concurrent Approval Regulation stipulates that Provincial ministries must proceed expeditiously with their review and consideration of the proponent's application(s) for eligible approval, and within 75 days of the date on which the proponent's application for an environmental assessment certificate was accepted, notify the proponent and the Environmental Assessment Office of any additional information required from the proponent in order to complete the application review.

Should an environmental assessment certificate be issued to a proponent, the ministry must, within 60 days after the issuance:

(a) issue the eligible approval,

(b) refuse to issue the eligible approval and provide reasons for the refusal, or

(c) specify a later date on which the proponent will be given a decision on the application for the eligible approval and provide reasons for the delay.

Although the Concurrent Approval Regulation stipulates sector ministries must proceed expeditiously with their permit review and recommendations to statutory decision makers, there is a potential risk for proponents following the issuance of an environmental assessment certificate, should a ministry proceed to recommendations while there may be outstanding information requirements and/or issues related to the permit review process.

With this in mind, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, in coordination with Provincial natural resource sector agencies, applies the synchronous permitting model (described below) in an effort to address the risks associated with the concurrent approval regulation.

For more information about the environmental assessment process, refer to the [EAO User Guide](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/pdf/EAO_User_Guide%20Final-Mar2011.pdf) and other information on the EAO website: [http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/](http://www.eao.gov.bc.ca/).

### ii. Synchronous Permitting

Synchronous permitting provides the same flexibility as the concurrent approval regulation for a coordinated EA and permit review process. Parties involved in the coordinated review process, however, are not bound by legislated timelines in order to make permitting decisions, post EA. Therefore, this option provides the time required to resolve potentially outstanding issues or substantial project changes that may arise during the coordinated review process. In addition, this option:

- Allows technical reviewers, who are typically the same members of the EA working group and the permitting advisory committee, the capacity to focus on the environmental assessment prior to the detailed permit review process;

- Provides proponents the time to address any significant issues that may require resolution during the EA, prior to finalizing their permit applications; and,
- Allows provincial statutory decision makers the time to identify where issues brought forward during the EA process may be appropriately addressed in permitting.

### iii. Sequential Permitting

Proponents may also choose to apply for sequential permitting. This process involves undergoing the EA process first; should an environmental assessment certificate be issued, permits for construction and operations are then subsequently applied for. The added benefit of sequential permitting is the ability for all parties involved in the review of a project to focus on the EA process prior to permitting.

### iv. Phases of the Coordinated authorizations Process

This section of the guide presents a detailed summary of the coordinated authorizations process. Figure 5 summarizes the four stages of the coordinated authorizations process.

![](20171006%20Eguide%20Content_html_b19a7fe0614ff40d.gif)

Figure 5 – Coordinated Authorizations Process Overview

### v. Guidance

MMPO has developed the following tools to help Project Leads guide Proponents through the Coordinated Authorizations Process:

#### Coordinated Authorizations Guide

This guide is intended to outline the coordinated authorizations review process for major mine projects that require multiple permits, licences or other authorizations (regulatory requirements) for construction and operation in the province of British Columbia. For the purposes of this guide, a major mine is a proposed or operating mine as defined in the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia (Code).

_Link to CAG_

#### Information Requirements Table

The Information Requirements Table (IRT) serves as the single list of information requirements for a Mines Act permit application, issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and an effluent discharge permit application under the Environmental Management Act (EMA), by the Ministry of Environment (MOE). The IRT is intended to:

Be used in conjunction with the document entitled, "Joint Application Information Requirements for Mines Act and Environmental Management Act Permits" and is intended for use in the development of both new and/or permit amendment applications. The information contained within the IRT will be developed to meet the unique nature of each project.

Aid MOE and MEM during the screening phase; inform clients of the detailed information required to support MA and EMA permit applications and ensure all the information necessary to support the MA and EMA applications is provided.

_Link to IRT_

#### Joint Application Information Requirements for Mines Act and Environmental Management Act Permits

The Application Information Requirements document sets out the information that is required to support a joint application for a Mines Act (MA) permit issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and (if required) an effluent discharge permit issued under the Environmental Management Act (EMA) by the Ministry of Environment (MOE). This document is intended for both new and existing major mines, including proposed major expansions/extensions of mining projects. The combined technical information requirements are intended to reduce overlap in technical information required by both ministries and enable one application, or bundled applications, to be submitted for review.

_Link to Joint AIR document_

# 4. Pre-Application Stage

The pre-application stage is an important stage of the process, and requires a collaborative effort by the MMPO Project Team, advisory committee and the proponent to support an efficient and timely process. There are no statutory timelines in the pre-application stage, and time spent ensuring that the review process is understood by all, that all required authorizations have been identified, and that identification and scoping of issues and information requirements have been thoroughly discussed and agreed to by the advisory committee will greatly increase the certainty of a timely review.

_Link to Pre-application Checklist_

## 1. Project Initiation

### i. Mine Review Advisory Committees

Under Section 9 of the _Mines Act_, the CIM has the authority to establish an advisory committee; in the context of the coordinated authorization process, the CIM will delegate a representative from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources to chair the advisory committee on his/her behalf for the review of applications for mine approvals and permits.

At the discretion of the CIM or delegated authority, the project may be referred to a Regional Mine Development Review Committee (MDRC) or a project-specific Mine Review Committee (MRC). The criteria considered by the CIM in determining the appropriate venue for review includes but is not limited to the scope, scale, and complexity of the project proposal.

In the context of the coordinated authorizations process, both the MDRCs and project-specific MRCs provide a single interagency venue for mine proponents to engage in pre-application discussions with natural resource sector agencies and First Nations. This gives proponents an early look at the review process, application information requirements, and responsibilities of all parties involved throughout the coordinated review process.

_Link to MRC TOR_

### ii. Early Engagement With Proponent

#### Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Outreach

The initial contact by major mine proponents to the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources should be to the office of the CIM who will refer the proponent to the appropriate branch within the Ministry, assigning a project lead and establish an advisory committee. The project lead assigned to the file will assist in the early conversations and the beginning of the pre-application stage to ensure that the project proposal is understood, the coordinated authorizations process is discussed and a preliminary identification of issues and next steps are undertaken.

Early outreach using the advisory committee can assist in the identification and scoping of issues and information requirements in advance of the coordinated authorizations process. Strong relationships, a collaborative information-gathering process and detailed understanding of the potential impacts and benefits of the project at this stage will give parties greater confidence for moving forward.

#### Project Description

For the review of large scale major mine projects, the CIM will typically assign the file to the Major Mine Permitting Office. MMPO will then assign a project lead that will develop the project specific Mine Review Committee and arrange the first committee meeting. At this meeting, the proponent will introduce their project to committee members and provide the proposed project description and related information, enabling the committee to:

- identify project components and activities both onsite and offsite;
- identify with the proponent the list of potential Provincial statutory authorizations to be reviewed by the committee;
- identify the baseline and impact assessment information requirements to satisfy the authorization applications;
- identify potential issues related to the project proposal including identifying homes for addressing issues which may be outside the scope of statutory permit ability to address, and,
- develop the engagement and consultation approach to meeting the government's duty to consult and accommodate First Nations.

The project description should be based on an understanding of the coordinated authorizations approach to bundling authorization applications to provide for efficient and effective consultation with First Nations and to enable a review of the project as a whole.

If the major mine proposal is proceeding from the provincial environmental assessment process, the proponent will have already prepared a project description that can be updated and expanded as necessary for the committee.

A template for a project description can be downloaded from: [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/natural-resource-major-projects/industry-sector/major-mines](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/natural-resource-major-projects/industry-sector/major-mines).

#### Public Outreach

Proponent-sponsored outreach to the public during project initiation can also contribute to an efficient review process by informing the public and providing the proponent with early identification of public issues and information requirements.

Major mine project proponents will ultimately need to engage with the public during both the environmental assessment and permit review processes (refer to Section 4.3.2 _Public Review and Comment_ for further details). Public participation in a project review process helps to ensure that community values and public goals for community development are considered in project planning and decision-making. Throughout the project process, it is the proponent's responsibility to provide opportunities for public comment on the project often through open houses and comment periods. It is fundamental to good development that members of the public have an opportunity to review and comment on plans before they are approved. In addition to providing a means of identifying and mitigating potential problems within the project, public consultation also offers the opportunity for developers to become familiar with the social and political fabric of the surrounding community.

### iii. Early Engagement and Consultation With First Nations

The legal responsibility to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate, lies with the Crown alone, as represented by the statutory decision makers. Project proponents can, however, be of great assistance in building relationships with First Nations and facilitating the exchange of information.

For pre-application engagement, Provincial staff can provide advice to proponents based on a scan of Aboriginal interests in the area. Before commencing consultation, Provincial staff will conduct an initial review as described in the Provincial Procedures and establish an initial level of engagement/consultation. This will include reviewing First Nations contacts and other related readily available information, including general archeological and historical information. This is also an opportunity for government to clarify any protocols contained in agreements with First Nations. If pre-application information sharing has taken place between the Proponent and First Nations, the Province will also review the findings from this early engagement.

First Nations engagement by the major mine proponent and consultation by the Province occurs throughout a mine's development, starting from the exploration stage. Planning for First Nations consultation at the coordinated authorizations stage will be in the context of the previous consultations and the previous knowledge and relationships that the Province and proponent have with the First Nations.

The proponent is advised to engage with all potentially affected First Nations in meaningful and collaborative dialogue and relationship building, and to gain an understanding of the potential impacts of the project and the First Nations' expectations for participation in the project.

Some key issues that will likely be of interest to potentially affected First Nations include:

- wildlife and fisheries harvest activities in the area;
- water quality;
- other traditional use activity (sustenance activities, village sites, spiritual sites, etc.);
- archaeology sites;
- socio-economic impacts, and
- capacity to participate in consultation and benefit sharing including jobs and contract opportunities.

Any joint studies with First Nations that provide ethnographic or legal information about the Aboriginal claims (to Aboriginal rights and/or title) in the area and/or the impact of the proposed activity on First Nations will also be of significant value.

Many First Nations will have the internal capacity, or want to develop the internal capacity, to take on a direct role in the collection of the information required by the proponent. Proponents are encouraged to involve First Nations in the collection of information as much as possible, as this is an opportunity to contribute to capacity building and to help First Nations develop a stronger understanding of the project impacts and benefits.

It should be noted that the proponent is not required to provide government with First Nations information that by arrangement with First Nations has been agreed to be treated as confidential.

Project proponents may assist Provincial staff by advising of any engagement activities with First Nations such as providing mitigation strategies, environmental monitoring or benefit sharing opportunities. Commitments to training programs, employment opportunities or other engagements by the proponent will help secure longer-term relationships with the mining sector in the area and build the capacity for engagement on other projects.

If the proponent's discussions with First Nations have extended to cover proposed statutory authorizations, it will be of particular value to the advisory committee to be aware of any mitigation strategies that have been proposed (such as providing a role for First Nations in the environmental monitoring or reclamation). If such strategies have not been identified, the proponent may seek assistance from the advisory committee at a later stage in the consultation process to secure such longer term commitments, where appropriate, in discussions with the First Nations.

Proponents are encouraged to refer to the additional information regarding engagement with First Nations, including utilizing all of the guidance and resources provided on the following BC Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation webpage: [http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/consultation/index.html](http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/consultation/index.html).

### iv. Strategic Agreements With First Nations

The Province of British Columbia is committed to establishing processes and institutions for shared decision-making about the land and resources and for revenue and benefit sharing with First Nations. Treaties and other agreements are important tools for First Nations to develop sustainable, healthy, and resilient communities. These agreements help build relationships with First Nations, resolve conflicts, or address concerns associated with development on traditional territories. Both treaties and non-treaty agreements are key aspects of this government's vision for a strong economy and secure future for all British Columbians.

### v. Land Use Planning

Provincial land use plans provide the framework and context for setting environmental, social, land use and resource management goals and objectives on Crown land. For some authorizations, land use plans establish legal objectives and policy that decision-makers must consider. Land use plans may also describe considerations relevant to engagement with First Nations and may be the basis for First Nations involvement in the authorizations process. As such, land use plans may inform the authorizations process.

## 2. Project Planning

### i. Project Charter

The purpose of this Project Charter is to provide a shared understanding of the coordinated authorization process for Major Mine Projects as it applies to each Project. The Project Charter also outlines the scope and objectives of the process, major risks and the roles and responsibilities of all Project Stakeholders and First Nations.

A Project Charter is developed at the outset of the coordinated authorizations process by a designated Project Lead with input from the Proponent and Project participants. Once complete the Project Charter will approved by the Project Director before going to the Major Mine Project Board for approval. The Project Charter is updated as necessary when elements within the Charter change.

The MMPO Project Charter has the following goals:

- To provide a shared understanding of how permit applications for a project are managed through the coordinated authorization process.
- To set the scope and objectives for the coordinated authorizations process for a project.
- To provide the proponent and the province with background on the project and First Nations engagement.
- To provide roles and responsibilities and an organizational chart for participants managing permit applications through the coordinated authorization process.
- To outline major deliverables and milestones of the coordinated authorizations process.
- To provide a communication plan outlining the reports and meetings included as part of the coordinated authorizations process.
- To outline the major risks to the schedule or scope of the coordinated authorizations process.

_Link to PC and PC Roll Out_

### ii. Baseline Schedule

The purpose of the baseline Schedule is to identify initial timelines for project milestones, activities and deliverables. Project schedules are developed, revised and maintained by MMPO Project Leads.

Steps to New Schedule Development:

1. New schedules are drafted by Project Leads using input from the proponent and members of the MRC.
2. The Project Management Centre (PMC) offers advice on the workloads of project resources over the timeline of the draft permit schedule.
3. The Project Lead revises the draft permit based on the advice of the PMC
4. The revised draft of the schedule then is shared with members of the MRC for feedback.
5. The Project lead develops the final draft of the permit schedule using the feedback of the members of the MRC.
6. The Project Director then takes the final draft permit schedule to the Chief Inspectors Office (CIO) for approval.
7. Final draft permit schedules approved by the CIO are then sent to the Major Mine Permitting Board for final approval.
8. Once new permit schedules are approved by the Board they are considered the baseline schedule for the project.

_Link to Schedule Template_

 
### iii. Resource Management

The availability of resources is an important part of developing meaningful schedules. The MMPO Project Management Centre maintains a workload forecast tool that estimates the availability of technical resources to review applications. The tool is used in planning and the development of new schedules.

_Link to Workload Forecast Tool_

 
### iv. Risk Management

Risks play a significant part in any project. The purpose of the risk management plan is to establish the framework in which the project team will identify risks and develop strategies to mitigate or avoid those risks.

_Link to MMPO Risk Management Plan and Risk Register_

 
### v. Change Management

Project Leads are responsible for identifying change within the project. When a valid change is identified the Project Lead will work with the Proponent, the PMC and members of the MRC to initiate the change management process with the completion of a change request form. The change request form details the impact on the schedule, change level, and benefits/costs of the proposed change. The Project Lead will review level 1 changes for approval and forward level 2 and 3 changes to the appropriate approval level. Once a change is reviewed and approved, the Project Lead will record the change into the Change Management Log and revise the permit schedule. If the change is rejected, the change request will be recorded in the change log as rejected.

**MMPO Change Management Process**

_Link to Change Management Plan, Change Form and Change Log_

### vi. Issue Management

Project Leads manage two types of issues throughout each stage of the project, technical issues and project issues. Technical Issues are generated by the MRC and are the responsibility of the proponent to resolve while project issues can be generated by anyone and impact the deliverables or milestones of the project.

Issue Management involves the implementation of five key processes:

- The identification of project issues
- The evaluation and documentation of project issues
- The determination of issue resolution actions
- The monitoring and control of assigned issue resolution actions
- The closure of project issues.

_Link to Issue Management Plan_

### vii. Information Management

Project Leads are responsible for organizing and storing project related information on the MMPO LAN. As well, as the chair of the MRC Project Leads are responsible for setting up and managing a SharePoint site for MRC related information.

_Link to SharePoint Set-up and Tips and Tricks Documents_

### viii. Draft Authorizations

Based on a review of a project description, the advisory committee works with the proponent to identify issues and information requirements, including any conditions or proponent commitments from the environmental assessment process that are within the scope of the committees review. For those issues that are outside the scope of review, it is important to provide an explanation of why they are not to be considered and where in other processes they may be addressed.

Regulatory authorizations that may be required for a major mine will vary depending on the project, and may include but not be limited to:

- _Environmental Assessment Act_ requirements, including a potential amendment to an existing Environmental Assessment Certificate;
- _Heritage Conservation Act_ requirements;
- _Forest Act_ occupant license-to-cut for removal of timber;
- Special Use permit under the Provincial Forest Use Regulation of the _Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act_ for access road construction off a mineral claim and within a Provincial Forest
- _Health Act_ Industrial Camp Regulation permits for construction and operation of camp facilities and potable water;
- _Water Sustainability Act_ approvals and licenses for changes in or about a stream or to store, use or divert water; _Land Act_ licenses and leases for infrastructure such as aggregate borrow pits and power lines off mining tenures, and
- Federal authorizations related to:
  - _Fisheries Act_ Section 35 for habitat alteration, disruption or destruction
  - Schedule 2 of the Metal Mine Effluent Regulation of the _Fisheries Act_ for approval to discharge deleterious material into a fish bearing habitat
  - _Migratory Birds Convention Act_ and its regulations for impacts on habitat of migratory birds;
  - _Navigation Protection Act_ for authorization to cross a navigable stream; and
  - _Explosives Act_ for manufacture and storage of explosives.

Some legislation has requirements to be addressed although no authorizations (permits) are involved, such as:

- _Species at Risk Act_, and the Canada – British Columbia Agreement on Species at Risk (2005), and
- _Fisheries Act_ - Metal Mining Effluent Regulations.

#### Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Authorizations

**Mineral Tenure**

Tenure provides an exclusive or preferred right of access to explore for, develop, and remove resources. For a major mine, tenure initially comes from a mineral claim under the _Mineral Tenure Act_ or a _Coal Act_ coal licence.

The Mineral Titles Office of MEM administers the statutes and manages the recording system pertaining to the acquisition and maintenance of mineral, placer and coal rights in the Province. More information: [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/mineral-titles](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/mineral-titles).

A mineral claim or coal licence must be converted to a mining lease under the _Mineral Tenure Act_ or a coal lease under the _Coal Act_ before production can exceed the limits specified in legislation.

**Waste Discharge Authorizations**

| Activity | Discharge from the mine site to the environment.
- Effluent discharges (such as acid and neutral rock drainage, tailing pond supernatant, mine influenced run-off and sewage);
- Air emissions (such as refuse incinerator emissions, emissions from large power generating plants, emissions from milling process), and
- Solid wastes (such as mill tailings, water treatment plant sludge, municipal and industrial refuse).

| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Waste Discharge Permit or Approval |
| Description | The _Environmental Management Act_ permit application can seek authorization for the site preparation and construction stage (erosion and sediment control and blasting residues) and operations stage (metal/chemical residues and contact water and tailings). Alternatively, the proponent may take a two-step approach to the _Environmental Management Act_ permit by seeking authorization for only the site preparation and construction stage and deferring authorization via a permit amendment for the operations stage until engineering is sufficiently detailed to support an application for amendment to the permit. Authorizations can take the form of a permit or, for short-term discharges up to 15 months duration, an approval. |

**Use Existing Industrial Road**

"Forest service road" is a designation under the _Forest Act_ which allows the road to be administered by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural development and requires the ministry to ensure that the road is maintained.

Industrial use of a forest service road must be authorised under a road use permit (RUP). Typically, a RUP authorizes use of one or more segments of road. Section 79 of the _Forest and Range Practices Act_'s Forest Planning and Practices Regulation allows the district manager to order the holder of an RUP to assume surface maintenance obligations for the segments covered by the RUP. The regulation also defines what the maintenance obligations entail. Subsequent users of the same road segments are not to be designated as having surface maintenance responsibilities; however, they are responsible to pay a reasonable cost to the user having the surface maintenance obligations.

The RUP application form is available at [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/resource-roads/engineering-publications-permits](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/resource-roads/engineering-publications-permits).

Holders of an agreement under the _Forest Act_ or _Range Act_ may have a road permit to construct, maintain and use an industrial road.

Road permits and special use permits are non-exclusive tenures which normally allow access to the public and other industrial users.

If an industrial road is under a road permit or a special use permit, the legislation requires other industrial users to give notice to the permit holder and to make a reasonable contribution towards road maintenance. Therefore, the parties must enter into a road maintenance agreement.

# 5. Screening and Review Stage

After completing necessary baseline and assessment studies to adequately address identified issues and potential impacts and meet statutory information requirements, the proponent should submit an applications package that meets the application requirements identified in the pre-application stage.

Members of the advisory committee, specifically the technical advisors to the statutory decision makers for each authorization under review will, with the coordinating assistance of the project lead, screen the draft application.

As noted above, the application requirements document developed by the proponent and accepted by the permitting agencies will assist in the screening of the draft application to ensure that it is complete and sufficient for a full review by the committee. If the technical advisors on the committee are satisfied with the applications package, the SDM's from each ministry will refer the completed applications to the advisory committee to review, initiating the coordinated review of the applications package. The advisory committee strives to complete a review of all submitted applications in a timely way.

Should a draft application package not pass the initial screening phase of the coordinated review process, the proponent will be asked to make the necessary revisions, requested by members of the advisory committee, to the draft application package for re-submission.

Once an application package has been accepted into the review phase of the coordinated authorization process, the project lead will inform the proponent that the draft applications for statutory authorizations has been screened and accepted for review. The proponent is responsible for distributing the final application and supporting documentation to advisory committee members and making it available to the public and other interest groups. Electronic distribution is encouraged where practicable and where it meets the needs of all reviewers; however, at least one hard copy is still required for EMPR.

The proponent will be asked to meet with the MRC early in the application review stage to summarize the content of the applications and help kick-start the review. The advisory committee provides the interagency and First Nations venue for technical review of the applications and for information exchange and discussions among all committee participants. The proponent will be expected to address all issues within the scope of review before the final report of the committee is forwarded to statutory decision makers. The project lead will work with the advisory committee and proponent to find homes for addressing any issues which are outside the scope of the statutory authorizations under review.

The goal of the project lead and other advisory committee members is to work collaboratively and strive to complete the application review stage in a timely manner.

## 1. Project Execution

### i. Meetings

Project meetings including MRC meetings will occur throughout the coordinated authorizations process and should be supported with agendas, action trackers and meeting notes to ensure efficiency and consistency.

_Link to Agenda Template_

_Link Action Tracker Template_

_Link to Meeting Notes Template_

### ii. Status Reports

Project Leads are responsible for providing regular Project Status Reports to their Directors. Project Status Reports consist of three major components to reporting project status:

- Project health: An indication if the project is on schedule or not and if not why not.
- Milestones: An indication of accomplishments and which milestones are complete, which ones are in progress, and which ones are coming up next.
- Issues and Risks: Brief details about each issue or risk to help managers make decisions on any necessary support.

_Link to Status Report Template_

### iii. Public Review and Comment

Applicants for a mining lease are also subject to a legal requirement to post a notice in the office of the chief gold commissioner stating that the recorded holder intends to apply for a mining lease. They must also publish this in one issue of the Gazette, and once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the mineral claim is situated. A person claiming a right to the minerals of any kind must commence a proceeding in the Supreme Court within 80 days after the date of posting of the notice.

Applicants for a _Mines Act_ permit are subject to a legal requirement to advertise project proposals upon submission of the application and make information available for public review, with 30 days available for public review and comment [Part 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 of the Code].

Additionally, applicants for an effluent discharge permit under the _Environmental Management Act_ are required to provide public notice of an application in accordance with the [Public Notification Regulation](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/202_94), available at [http://www.bclaws.ca/](http://www.bclaws.ca/).

Other authorizations typically required for ancillary infrastructure like transmission lines, access roads, camps and staging areas also require both public adverting and stakeholder engagement; for example, a _Land Act_ tenure application for a transmission line.

The project lead will coordinate with members of the advisory committee to provide direction to the proponent regarding the format and method of public notification, including opportunities to make a joint notification for the ancillary and primary authorizations that require public advertising including making the applications available for review and a common public comment review period.

### iv. First Nations Consultation and Accommodation

Before issuing authorizations for any mining activity, the Province has a legal responsibility to consult and, where appropriate, accommodate First Nations with Aboriginal interests in the project area. The Province also has treaty-specific responsibilities where there are established treaty rights. The advisory committee's First Nations consultation advisor is responsible for leading and coordinating the First Nations consultation process.

The procedures were released in July 2010 as interim in order to review them with First Nations. To view the document, click on [Updated Procedures for Meeting Legal Obligations When Consulting First Nations: Interim](http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/reports/down/updated_procedures.pdf).

Accommodation includes activities to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts or concerns respecting Aboriginal interests brought forwards by a First Nation during engagement. Accommodation options could include:

- Changing the timing of a proposed activity;

- Altering the footprint or location of a proposed activity;
- Avoiding the Aboriginal interest;
- Environmental monitoring, and,
- Other mitigation strategies (i.e. agreements).

Proponent-driven initiatives such as modifying mine plans to minimize potential impacts, avoiding sensitive areas, developing mitigation strategies, carrying out environmental monitoring programs or developing benefit and other business agreements with First Nations can also contribute to the decision-making process.

## 2. Project Control

### i. Tracking Schedule

Each change to the baseline schedule should be documented in a tracking schedule. The tracking schedule provides an at a glance summary of the expected and actual dates for milestones and deliverables.

_Link to tracking schedule template_

### ii. Change Tracking

When a change to the scope or schedule of a project has been identified the Project Lead will gather details regarding the proposed requirement for change. With the assistance of the person requesting the change, the Project Lead will complete a Change Request Form. The Change Request Form summarizes the changes including background, proposed change, benefits, consequences, change analysis impact and approvals. As well, the Project Lead will track all project changes in a Change Log.

_Link to change request form and change log_

### iii. Issue Tracking

The Project Lead (MRC Chair) will track technical issues raised by MRC members throughout the coordinated authorizations process in an Issues Tracking Table. The management and responsibility for the issue tracking should be worked out among all review participants including the Proponent to ensure efficiencies, accuracy, objectivity and it is useful to SDMs.

_Link to Technical Issue log and Project Issue Log_

### iv. Risk Tracking

The Project lead can track risks with a risk register. All project risks are documented and prioritized in the risk register. Best practice for risk management is to review the risk register regularly and address them during project status meetings.

_Link to Risk Register template_

### v. Lessons Learned Log

Throughout each project life cycle, lessons are learned and opportunities for improvement are discovered. Documenting lessons learned helps the team discover the root causes of problems that occurred and avoid those problems in later project stages or future projects. It also allows for better planning of later project stages and future projects, improving implementation of new projects, and preventing or minimizing risks for future projects.

_Link to lessons learned log_

### vi. Action Tracker

Actions coming out of project meeting and discussions with stakeholders or First Nations can be easily tracked and logged using an action tracker. Actions should be reviewed regularly and closed out when complete.

_Link Action Tracker Template_

# 6. Reporting and Decisions Stage

The advisory committee provides recommendations to statutory decision makers (SDMs) and does not have any decision-making authority. At the end of the committee's review of the applications, the project lead will prepare a summary report on behalf of the committee and submit it to the appropriate SDMs for permit decisions. The summary report contains information on the proposed project, the review process and timelines, the issues raised during review and how they were resolved, and a summary of First Nations and public consultation.

As well, the First Nations consultation advisor for the advisory committee will prepare a detailed First Nations consultation report for SDMs, which identifies First Nations interests and suggested mitigations, provides details of the consultation process, and assesses how the process satisfied the Province's legal obligations to consult and accommodate.

## 1. Project Closeout

### i. Mine Review Committee Report

The purpose of this report is to provide SDMs with information from which to make an informed and durable decision. As such, care should be taken to ensure the report contains:

- the appropriate information on the process undertaken to meet each statutory requirement; information distribution and comment;
- identification of issues raised and how they were addressed and if not, why not; and
- matters for each decision-maker to take into consideration in making a decision.

The report is not intended to be a Reasons for Decision document and does not preclude additional information a SDM may use to make a decision or to develop permit conditions.

_Link to Mine Review Committee Report Template_

### ii. First Nations Consultation Report

The purpose of this report is to provide Statutory Decision Makers (SDMs) with an overview of First Nations consultation that has taken place during the coordinated authorizations process, including the scope of the consultations, the approach, summary of communications and meetings and applicable agreements. The report is typically completed by the First Nations Consultation Advisor from FLNRO assigned to the project with the support of the MMPO Project Lead.

_Link to Examples of FN Consultation Reports_

### iii. Lessons Learned Summary Report

A summary report of lessons learned is recommended to be completed by the Project Lead after the submission of the final decision package to the statutory decision makers. The report should address the following key issues:

- Assessment of goals and objectives; and
- Identification of activities or areas needing additional effort; and
- Identification of effective activities or strategies; and
- Assessment of the roles and interactions of the organizations/ministries involved in the project.
